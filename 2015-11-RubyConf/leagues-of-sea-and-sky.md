## This talk is about Partnership

in
* Sea
* Air
* Space

### Sea
Sailors needed to be able to calculate longitude at sea, latitude was known with sextant.
Ships were being lost because of this issue.


There is a prize for this announced.

There were two possible methods to do this
1) Trig with moon - very complex
2) chronometer - knowing the time of sunset vs. sunset at a known location can help calculate but clocks are not viable at the time either

### John Harrison (Farmer) vs. Nevile Baskiline
Harrison builds a chronometer (sea clock)
This took 5 years and after testing it, he found some small issues.

.. and builds another
this took 5 years more and the same result.

.. and builds another
This one took 17 years
Each works but he wants to tweak it and make it work better

The third one is much smaller and is essentially a large pocket watch.
It works very well

Nevile, his competator who is trying to get the trig solutions to work, becomes the new judge of the competition and changes the rules and requires John give up his clock.

John appeals to the king and he gets most of the money but no recognition

This is the story of disastrously failed partnership

John worked alone and did not communicate well

What if these two people could have worked together?

FYI: The union of these two methods is used in NASA work.

## Air
200 years later, after the Wright Bros. first flight

Raymond Ortiz creates a new prize to make non-stop flight between New York and Paris.

At the time, flight is considered unsafe and therefore used only as a curiosity.

Charles Lingburgh a barnstormer and early air mail pilot decides to join the prize compatition.

He joins after 5 years of no attempts, but people are starting to try.

Works with Donald Hall to build a plane, in 2 months to fly across the Atlantic.

Donald completes the Spirit of St. Louis

Heaviest plane ever built at this size due to need for fuel. Most everything else is removed.

It had no front window!

The plane was a single purpose device, made only to do one thing, cross the Atlantic.

Lindburgh succeeds and is a celebrity

.. but Donald Hall is not

even though he was the engineer who was necessary to the success

Lindburgh did not give credit to the people who built the plane.

Sadly this is again a lack of partnership.

## Space
This talk is about Jeff and his team who landed Spirit on Mars.  His team built the maneuvering system for the rover.

Rover explores but the challenge is that the explorer is not present.

Team wants to make the explorers feel that they are there.

360 degree imaging is hard to comprehend because our brains are not make to navigate this way.

So the team turns to video games and 3d / oculus

Perceptions are far improved

So they worked with Microsoft with MS Hololens and formed a partnership

They moved team to Redmond

..and moved into a house together to compress team building timeframe

JPL and MS shared knowledge and learned fro each other.

Message: Think about things AND PEOPLE you are encountering
find out what they are doing
and how you can do them together
