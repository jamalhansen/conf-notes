Storytelling via the psycology of professional wrestling

He was sitting to watch Summer Slam in August.  4 hours long

Beforehand he watched a half hour of nXt, the farm league.
was recommended a match by his friend
Women title bout

Sasha makes big smarmy entrance
Bayley makes grand entrance, seems friendly

Within 5 minutes, he is invested and hates Sasha, routing for Bayley even though he has never heard of either

People were "emotionally moved" by the match

## This is interesting

knows it is fake
more intersting than some books
not elaborate or well made
yet he and others are invested

They put together a basic story and drew the audience in

## Wrestling is fake
But the actions are real, they may be exaggerated and done for efffect but they happen.

It is a form of acting

There is no choreographer so the players have to put it together themselves

A Story has

* Characters
* Setting
* Plot
    * Conflict
    * Resolution

Done to manipulate the emotions of the watcher.

Location - wrestling ring, sometimes different (i.e. steel cage) but generally the same.

## There are rules

* a sporting like event
* can win with a pin
* you can force a submission but putting people in a hold they can not escape
* no foreign objects
* no below the belt
* but if the ref does not see it, it did not happen

## Characters

one dimensional

one of two archetypes

### babyface

* hero
* bigger than life
* cool but not too cool
* stand up to threats
* relateable
overcomes hardship
hard worker
underdog (sometimes)
charisma

Examples
    * Rock
    * Hogan
    * Buffy
    * Winston Smith (1984)
    * Han Solo

You cheer for the babyface

### Heel
more important than the babyface

* foreign
* has unearned authority
* hateable
* jerk, but a credible threat so has some advantage or skill


Examples
    * Iron Sheik
    * Sasha
    * Khan
    * big brother
    * Cersei Lannister

## Plot

Wrestling Match

Wrestlers are told which role they play

### Sections of match

* Shine - babyface shines, they could win!
* Cutoff - heel will cheat to gain advantage
* Heat - Heel is winning, will not be flashy but will beat up the babyface, makes audience uncomfortable
* Hope spot - high risk maneuver by babyface to turn the match
* Heat - ... again, hope spot did not work
* Comeback - babyface "figures out" how to win, digs deep, spectacular
* Finish - one of two possible outcomes
    Clean finish - babyface wins!
    Screw job finish - Heel wins by cheat

All parts of a story are here, any story

### Putting it all together

To make drama
..even though you know it is fake

The actions have to make sense

Shawn Michaels - has super kick for a finishing move, so heel needs attack the leg not the arm

The Big Show - is huge so strong and slow heel.  Babyface is going to not take direct attack.  Smart attacker needs to moke quickly and take out the legs.

Star wars sequels are terrible because the heels look stupid and not dangerous

Superman does a good job of making the babyface look like he faces strong adversity

Professional Wrestling is a distilled version of all storytelling.
