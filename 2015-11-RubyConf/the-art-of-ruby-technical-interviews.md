# The art of ruby technical interviews

@cmar - who has been doing interviews for a long time

## Experience
When you are starting out you feel like you are in a catch 22, how can you get experience on your resume so that people will hire you.

The answer is to build something
Find something in your life that you are passionate about to build and start working on it.

Use multiple gems, some gems are frequently used by companies, try to include these, *devise* is one of these.

Push your work to Github, so that people can see it.

Deploy to something like Heroku so that people can see that you it works

## Example
Maybe you like playing Magic: The Gathering and have an idea for tracking card values.  Make it and add the fork me on github banner.

BUT clean up the code before showing it off.

Describe what you have built.. i.e. rubber ducking and make documentation.

## Contribute

This is the second half of your resume

### Every project needs documentation
* shows understanding of code
* shows ability to pull request and work with others

There are lots of open source projects out there that need help with documentation.  Find them and pitch in

## Resume

Most developers (interviewers) are lazy and read straight down the resume

You can use this to your advantage and shape the interview with the flow of your resume.

## Practice

* Practice the interview conversation, use a mirror or a friend.
* Practice coding on whiteboard and speak while writing
* Practice creating a domain model on a whiteboard

When you write on the whiteboard, start in the middle to give yourself space if you need to add work on any side.

## Ruby is a community
Know the community
find thought leaders: @matz, @tenderlove, @avdi, @sandi, etc

Podcasts
Know latest versions and what is happening with them
rubyrouges is a good one

## Tools of the craft
Give an opinion and share the tools that you use, it shows that you use them.  But be open to use the tools that are preferred by the team you want to join.

## What are interviewers looking for
* curious minds
* coachable
* passion
* entheusiasm

## Q: Will it be fun building things with you?

## Ruby Interview questions
* enumarable
* .each .map .inject
* Rails: active record assocaitions
    * has_many belongs_to has_many_through

## Algorithms
* not necessarily about correctness, just need to do better than others
* so solve it, brute force
    then remove..
    * Bottlenecks
    * Unnecessary Work
    * Duplicated Work

## Know how the web works
* request / response

## Hard questions
point of these is to see how you approach it
A: "I have never thought about this"
.. but I would start with the smallest thing I do know, i.e. the size of a ping pong ball (Q: how many fit on the bus)

"Can we pair on a solution?"
read: Cracking the Coding Interview if you like


never say: I could just google that.  Not the point of the interview

## Ending
* Always ask a question
* There is a place for you
    * Not every company is, but there is one
