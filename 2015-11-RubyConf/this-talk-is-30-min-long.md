This talk is 30 min long
Noel Rappin @noelrap http://www.tablexi.com

How far do you live from an airport?

say 20 min.

But this is based on a series of assumptions.
* transportation
* traffic
* weather
* car trouble

Failure on these will take more time
(and not less)

Yet this 20 min estimate is valuable and the defacto answer

# The following is a way that Noel makes good estimates
people say developers are bad at estimates?
* what about home remodel?
* contracting / building

These have lots of scope creep and people do not understand the needs until after they have started

## Big Dig
Notoriously long project in Boston

Was originally estimates at $5.8 mill
so far $21 M

..so not just our problem

## Software
In theory it is easier to estimate because it is not physical

### What if we did not estimate
What if we just did stuff and got paid?

_For most of us it does not work like this_

Customers expect to have some sort of idea of how long /much a project is, if they fund it

## Estimates are Communication
.. with $$$
So it is hard to change
Once it has a $ it is what is expected

Communicates
* investment
* progress
* scope

All things that need to be done as part of a good project

## Bad Esimates have consequences
They Communicate

* Unrealistic expectations
* Way too much (micro managing)

..so lets just do good estimates

# Easy! just wait until the end to estimate!
estimating at the beginning is the worst time to make an estimate (for correctness)

many unknowns (you may not even know about them)

## Even when you know nothing..

### Agile terms
* Feature / Story - unit of work in a project (preferably isolated)
* Iteration - unit of planning (1-2 weeks)
* Point - size of a story
* velocity - most important (number of points in an iteration)

### Kind of a theory of estimates
entire project vs. features

Nobody really cares about feature estimates
They want to know when users can use it
.. but are useful because they aggregate

Estimates are estimates, but are probibilistic

Chance of rain: 50% <--- example

individual features estimates only have value in aggregate

these can throw the individual estimate off
* misunderstanging problem
* scope creep
* unknown complexity
* rework

Developers are optimistic!
* about abilities
* support time

Sometimes there is pressure to create low estimates
* has to be done by x
* I know this is going to be a long conversation if I say it will take x days
* I cannot sell this at $$ so I will quote lower

A lower estimate does not make it less complex, you are just setting yourself upfor more difficult conversations later on.

Not a great way to estimate

! Embrace unceratinty NOT precision

## What goes into an estimate?
* complexity
* skill
* how much time can be focused on the task in that time

Time - We are bad at estimating time on task
but we are consistantly bad over time

Developer skill -  We are really really bad at this and it is TOXIC
but we are consistant over time

Complexity - We are actually pretty good at estimating this


## So estimate complexity and let the time sort itself out
and we end up with a Point (agile definition)
point is an arbitrary measurement of complexity

from there you learn how many points can be done in a week. From there the rest does not matter because it averages out

Changes to these can modify your averages to beware:
* team size
* story makeup
* environment

.. and one-off estimates are still a problem

## But how do I estimate at the beginning of a project


AKA the worst way except for everything else I tried
.. Fake your velocity
* do not chace precision
* use a range (low and high value)

### Assign points
1 - easy
3 - has complexity
5 - has a lot more complexity
8 - even more..
13 - etc

Round up
use a point range at the beginning and refine as you go

.. hopefully you end up with a aggregate point range for the project

Now apply a load factor (say 5 - 7 hours a point, yes oversimplified but gets you to a number)

If range is too broad, you can try to give an average

can multiply hours by rate to get a $$, beware customers will hear only low number, so emphasize what needs to happen to hit that low number.

Also this is an estimate so it can and will change
